# Labour inspectors are public officials or other authorities who are responsible for three key labour inspection 
# activities: a) securing the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection 
# of workers while engaged in their work, such as provisions relating to hours, wages, safety, health and welfare, 
# the employment of children and young persons, and other connected matters, in so far as such provisions are 
# enforceable by labour inspectors; b) supplying technical information and advice to employers and workers 
# concerning the most effective means of complying with the legal provisions; c) bringing to the notice of the 
# competent authority defects or abuses not specifically covered by existing legal provisions. Labour inspectors 
# have the authority to initiate processes that may lead to legal action. For more information, refer to the 
# concepts and definitions page.
